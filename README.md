AWS CDK infrastructure for [AIAssisted-Core](https://github.com/reaktif-io/AIAssisted-Core) — a GPT-2 code generation project that predated GitHub Copilot by over a year. The vision was sound but the base model (GPT-2 124M) was too small and the market didn't exist yet. Shelved in 2020.

## Stack

AWS CDK (TypeScript), EC2, Application Load Balancer
